# Patients-emergency-room-visit-dashboard
Hi Everyone, This is my latest Power BI dashboard called "Patients Emergency Room Report"
Key Observations-
1. Higher visits during weekdays: Significantly more visits occur on weekdays compared to weekends.

2. Adults dominate visit numbers: Adults form the largest group of patients visiting the emergency room.

3. Monthly fluctuation in visits: Visits peak in August and are at their lowest in February.

4. Satisfaction Levels: Most patients are satisfied, with an average rating of 5.47. However, a large portion of the services remain unrated.

5. Wait Times: The average wait time is relatively high at 35.26 minutes, which might affect patient satisfaction.
